In terms of pricing, mid-range priced models, specifically those in the $50,000 to $100,000 category, exhibit the highest demand, with sales volumes peaking at 24,309,128 units. This suggests that consumers are most inclined towards models that offer a balance between affordability and premium features. When examining sales by model, the 7 Series and X6 emerge as the most popular, with sales volumes of 8,177,442 and 8,099,240 units respectively, indicating a strong consumer preference for these particular models.

In terms of market segments, color preferences show that Black is the most popular, with 14,450,883 units sold, followed closely by Red and White. This suggests a diverse consumer preference for car colors, with Black leading the way. Fuel type analysis indicates a growing trend towards sustainability, with Hybrid and Electric vehicles leading sales volumes at 21,712,670 and 21,182,367 units respectively, surpassing traditional Petrol and Diesel vehicles. Transmission preferences show a slight edge for manual transmission vehicles, with 43,066,966 units sold compared to 41,845,997 units for automatic transmission, indicating a marginal consumer preference for manual gearboxes.

Engine size analysis reveals that smaller engine sizes, particularly those in the (0,2.4] category, have the highest sales volume at 22,515,123 units, suggesting a consumer preference for more fuel-efficient and potentially cost-effective vehicles. There is a notable drop in sales for mid-range engine sizes, with a slight recovery for the largest engine size category. Overall, the data highlights that mid-range pricing, specific model types, color preferences, fuel efficiency, and smaller engine sizes are significant drivers of BMW sales volume.
