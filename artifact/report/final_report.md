## **Business Question 1**
The business question: Analyze sales performance trend over time. Dimensions to be considered are year, and year plus region.

### **Main Finding**
From 2020 to 2024, BMW's sales performance showed a fluctuating trend. Sales increased from 16,310,843 units in 2020 to a peak of 17,920,946 units in 2022, followed by a decline in 2023 to 16,268,654 units, and a rebound in 2024 to 17,527,854 units. This indicates a general upward trend over the five-year period, despite the dip in 2023.

Regionally, Africa, Asia, and South America saw sales increase from 2020 to 2022, a decline in 2023, and a recovery in 2024. Europe experienced a consistent increase until 2022, followed by a drop in 2023 and a slight recovery in 2024. The Middle East peaked in 2020, with fluctuations in subsequent years, while North America declined from 2020 to 2021, rose in 2022, and declined again by 2024. These trends highlight variability in sales performance across different markets, with some regions experiencing more volatility than others.

## **Business Question 2**
The business question: Highlight top-performing and under-performing models or markets.

### **Main Finding**
The 7 Series and X6 are the top-performing models, with sales volumes of 8,177,442 and 8,099,240 units, respectively. The M5 and 3 Series also show strong performance. In contrast, the X5, i3, and M3 models are under-performing, with lower sales volumes. This suggests a consumer preference for the 7 Series and X6 models.

Regionally, South America is the top-performing market with a sales volume of 13,643,807 units, indicating strong demand for BMW vehicles in this region. Overall, while certain models like the 7 Series and X6 drive sales, the South American market significantly contributes to BMW's success. Conversely, models such as the X5, i3, and M3 indicate potential areas for improvement or strategic focus.

## **Business Question 3**
The business question: Explore key drivers of sales (e.g., price, market segment, or model type), compare across dimensions. Market segment refers to color, fuel_type, transmission, and engine_size. For price and engine_size, use Price_USD_Category and Engine_Size_L_Category fields.

### **Main Finding**
Key drivers of BMW sales include pricing, model type, color, fuel type, transmission, and engine size. Mid-range priced BMWs, particularly those in the $75,000 to $100,000 category, exhibit the highest demand. The 7 Series, X6, and 3 Series are the most popular models. Black, Red, and White cars lead in sales volume, with Black being the most popular.

Hybrid and Electric vehicles show strong demand, indicating a shift towards environmentally friendly options. Manual transmission vehicles slightly outperform automatic ones. Smaller engine sizes, particularly those in the (0,2.4] category, have the highest sales volume, suggesting a preference for vehicles with smaller engines.

## **Business Question 4**
The business question: Identify product market fit of each region (e.g., model, color, fuel_type, transmission, Engine_Size_L_Category or Price_USD_Category). Highlight the regions with the highest sales percentage. Use sales percentage as the main metric.

### **Main Finding**
BMW sales percentages across regions reveal distinct preferences. The 3 Series and 5 Series perform well across multiple regions, with the 3 Series leading in Asia, Europe, and North America, while the 7 Series is favored in Africa and the Middle East. South America prefers the X6. Black and White are popular colors, with regional preferences for Silver in North America and Red in South America.

Hybrid and Electric vehicles have a strong market presence, with Hybrid cars leading in Asia and North America, and Electric vehicles preferred in Europe. Automatic transmissions are slightly more popular in Africa and Asia, while manual transmissions are favored in other regions. Smaller engine sizes, particularly the "1. (0,2.4]" category, hold a significant share in all regions. Mid-range price categories dominate sales across all regions.

## **Business Question 5**
The business question: Identify shift in consumer preferences over time (e.g., model, color, fuel_type, transmission, Engine_Size_L_Category or Price_USD_Category). In each dimension, there can be more than one preference that is favored by consumers. Use sales percentage as the main metric.

### **Main Finding**
From 2020 to 2024, consumer preferences have shifted. The X6 and 5 Series have gained traction, while the 7 Series maintained a strong presence. Blue and Red colors have gained popularity, with Blue emerging as the most favored color by 2024. Hybrid and Electric vehicles have become more popular, with Hybrid vehicles regaining the top position in 2024. Manual transmissions maintain a slight lead over automatic ones, although the gap has narrowed. Smaller and mid-sized engines have become more popular, while larger engine sizes have declined. Price preferences show a modest shift towards more affordable categories.

## **Conclusion**
The analysis of BMW's sales data from 2020 to 2024 reveals a generally upward trend in sales, despite fluctuations in certain years and regions. The 7 Series and X6 models are top performers, with South America emerging as a key market. Mid-range pricing, Hybrid and Electric vehicles, and smaller engine sizes are significant drivers of sales. Regional preferences vary, with the 3 Series and 5 Series models, Black and White colors, and mid-range price categories showing strong sales percentages across multiple regions. Consumer preferences have shifted towards certain models, colors, and environmentally friendly fuel types over time.

## **Actionable Insight**
To capitalize on these findings, BMW should focus on strengthening its presence in South America and continue to promote its top-performing models, the 7 Series and X6. Expanding the range of Hybrid and Electric vehicles could capture the growing demand for environmentally friendly options. Additionally, tailoring marketing strategies to regional preferences, such as promoting specific models and colors, can enhance BMW's market presence and drive sales growth.
