## **Business Question 3**
The business question: explore key drivers of sales (e.g., price, market segment, or model type), compare across dimensions. Market segment refers to color, fuel_type, transmission, and engine_size. For price and engine_size, use Price_USD_Category and Engine_Size_L_Category fields.

### **Main Finding**
Key drivers of BMW sales include mid-range pricing, specific models, color, fuel type, transmission, and engine size. Mid-range priced BMWs ($75,000-$100,000) have the highest demand, with 24,309,128 units sold. The 7 Series, X6, and 3 Series are the most popular models, with the 7 Series leading at 8,177,442 units. The X5 has the lowest sales volume.

Color preferences show Black, Red, and White as most popular, with Black leading at 14,450,883 units. Hybrid vehicles have the highest sales volume at 21,712,670 units, followed by Electric vehicles, while Diesel vehicles have the lowest sales. Manual transmissions are slightly preferred, with 43,066,966 units sold compared to 41,845,997 for automatic.

Smaller engine sizes have higher sales, with the smallest category (0,2.4] leading at 22,515,123 units. Mid-range engine sizes see a decrease, while the largest category (4.1,5.0] experiences a slight recovery. Overall, mid-range pricing, specific models, certain colors, hybrid and electric fuel types, manual transmissions, and smaller engine sizes are key sales drivers.

## **Business Question 4**
The business question: identify product market fit of each region.

### **Main Finding**
BMW's market performance varies across regions in terms of sales volume, pricing, model popularity, fuel type, transmission, and color preferences. Europe leads in sales, followed by the Middle East and North America. Africa shows strong demand, while Asia and South America have lower sales volumes. Asia commands the highest average price, while South America offers the most affordable pricing.

The 3 Series and 5 Series are popular across regions, with the X6 and i3 gaining traction in South America. Hybrid and Electric vehicles are popular, especially in Europe and North America. Manual transmissions are slightly more favored in Europe and the Middle East, while North America prefers automatic.

Color preferences vary, with Blue most preferred in Africa, Black in Asia, Red in Europe and North America, Grey in the Middle East, and White in South America. These findings highlight the need for regional customization in product offerings to align with local consumer preferences and market dynamics.

## **Business Question 5**
The business question: shift in consumer preference over time (e.g., model, color, fuel_type, transmission, Engine_Size_L_Category or Price_USD_Category). Use sales percentage as main metric.

### **Main Finding**
From 2020 to 2024, consumer preferences for BMW models, colors, fuel types, transmission types, engine sizes, and price categories have shifted. The X6 and 5 Series gained popularity in 2024, while the M3 and X5 declined. The 7 Series maintained a strong presence, and the i3 and i8 showed fluctuations. Blue and Red gained popularity, with Blue most favored in 2024, while Black and Silver fluctuated.

Hybrid vehicles consistently gained popularity, while diesel and petrol declined. Electric vehicles fluctuated but remained significant. Manual transmissions saw a trend, though the gap with automatic transmissions narrowed by 2024. Smaller engine sizes (0 to 3.3 liters) became more popular, while larger sizes (3.3 to 5.0 liters) decreased. Price preferences shifted slightly towards more affordable vehicles. These findings highlight evolving consumer preferences over the analyzed period.
