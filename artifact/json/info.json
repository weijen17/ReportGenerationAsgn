Initially, sales volume increased from 16,310,843 units in 2020 to a peak of 17,920,946 units in 2022. However, there was a notable decline in 2023, with sales dropping to 16,268,654 units. By 2024, sales rebounded to 17,527,854 units, indicating an overall upward trend despite the dip in 2023.\n\nWhen examining sales performance by region, similar patterns of fluctuation are observed. In Africa, Asia, and South America, sales increased from 2020 to 2022, experienced a decline in 2023, and then rose again in 2024. Europe followed a similar pattern, with a consistent increase until 2022, a drop in 2023, and a slight recovery in 2024. The Middle East saw a peak in 2020, followed by fluctuations, with a decline in 2023 and a slight increase in 2024. North America displayed a more erratic trend, with a decrease in 2021, a rise in 2022, a slight decline in 2023, and a further decrease in 2024.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that while there were regional variations, most regions experienced a recovery or growth by 2024 after the dip in 2023. This indicates a general resilience in the market, with sales volumes showing an upward trajectory over the five-year period, despite the temporary setback in 2023.",
